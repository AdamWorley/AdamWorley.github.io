{% include JB/setup %}

So here it is, my first blog post... isn't it hideous and awkward? Well I'm sure it will only get worse.

I hope to write the occasional post, usually about stuff that I will probably want to look back on in the future to;

1. Look back at and cringe at my own incompetence.
2. Use information I found in the past to help me again because I will no doubt forget a very small terminal command that will once again leave me scratching my head for 4 hours.
3. To hopefully help all two people that will find and read this, in their own similar endeavours.

Do be prepared for some rather interesting typos aswell (snes = sense, not the game console from the 90's by the way).

#### More info about me

So I currently study Computer Science (Games) at the university of Brighton and I am rather a 'Jack of all trades, master of none' kind of guy; with my interest in computer sciences, computers, and science in gerneal. From the microscopic to the macroscopic, I've always found there is something interesting to be found. As such, I may even include some tid bits from here and there, [such as this!](http://www.wired.com/2015/03/weird-quantum-behavior-light-captured-lab/) It's amazing that the duality of light (or more technically, electromagnetic energy) has now been seen to be acting as both a wave and particle in a single experiment.

Media is another one of my interests, with a keen interest in photography, filmography and design (Can't say I'm good at any), I enjoy working in photoshop and watching youtube channels such as [Film Riot](https://www.youtube.com/user/filmriot) and [Video Co-pilot](http://www.videocopilot.net/) to see the techniques used in the profession.

#### Why mada360?

Well quite simply, I'm not very imaginative, just my name backwards and the first auto suggested name of just 'mada', was already taken and so mada360 it was, from then on it stuck with me.

        Welcome to my site
    </h3>
    <h6>
        Hello and welcome to this fairly baron site; I am a computer scientist at the university of brighton and this site is a work in progress; I hope to include projects I am working on and intend to work towards.

    <h6>
        I could have worked for ages to produce a website that fits the 'material' style, touted by Google, however, why would I do that? When there is this fantastic one already available, so thanks to all the people that made this! (I hope you included yoursleves in the source of this site.)
